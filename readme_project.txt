Just run Game.java and the game window should pop up!




/**********************************************************************

 *  specification that you added? If so, describe them here.
 **********************************************************************/


I added some design elements such as coloring the entire game. I also added
another score measure where the score was the value of the highest piece in
the grid.





/**********************************************************************
 *  List all the files in project.zip and explain their purpose.

1. Game.java - This is the class where the main game runs. All the required objects 
  are created in this class and this is where the game is executed
  
2. GameScreen.java - Class that is responsible for drawing all the 
  components of the game.
  
3. Grid.java - Class that creates the Grid object and holds the main logic of the
  game
  
4. Piece.java - Class that creates the Piece object and has the relevant fields
  and methods to a Piece object in the game.
